# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on a Hubot script to easily allow for using the URL shortener https://tr.im from Slack. I added the framework using yeoman.io, and added Code Climate to point out where I can use better style.

![I created a repo and made an initial commit, so as you can tell, things are getting pretty serious.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B9B45qUIQAAAJKJ.png:large)

**Thoughts** I try to find the fastest and easiest way to do something, rather than the most aesthetically pleasing, emphasizing effectiveness over efficiency.
